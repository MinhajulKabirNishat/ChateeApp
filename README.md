# ChateeApp
# Shell-Based Network Chat Application

A terminal-based chat application built using Shell scripting and netcat (nc) that allows two or more users to communicate via text messages from different computers over a network.

<b>This project is for beginners like (me:) to understand shell scripting, networking concepts, and client-server communication.</b>

# Project Overview

<b>This chat system allows users to:</b>

1. Run a chat server
2. Connect as clients from different machines
3. Exchange real-time messages using the terminal

The project starts with simple features and gradually adds more advanced functionality.

# Technologies Used

*Shell Script (Bash)

*netcat (nc)

*Git Bash (Windows)

*VS Code

*TCP Networking

# Planned Features
<b>Phase 1: Core Features</b>

These features make the chat system functional.

 1. Server and client mode
 2. Two-way text messaging
 3. Works from two different terminals
 4. Exit command (/exit)
 5. Clear screen command (/clear)
 6. Basic error handling

<b> Phase 2: User Experience Improvements</b>

These features make the chat more user-friendly.

 1. Username support
 2. Message format with username
 3. Timestamp on messages
 4. Join and leave notifications
 5. Help command (/help)

<b>Phase 3: Logging & Commands</b>

These features add realism and usefulness.

 1. Chat history logging to file
 2. Command handling system
 3. Show connected users
 4. Message rate control (basic anti-spam)

<b>Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)</b>

These are advanced and impressive features.
 1. Colored messages using ANSI codes
 2. Private messaging (/msg username)
 3. Password-protected chat room
 4. Encrypted messages (using OpenSSL)
 5. Auto-reconnect support

# How the Project Works 
*One user starts the server

*Other users connect as clients

*Messages are sent over the network using netcat

*Shell script handles input, output, and commands


# Requirements

*Windows OS

*Git Bash

*netcat (nc)

*VS Code

*Internet connection (for remote chat)

# Future Scope

1. Convert to multi-user chat
2. Add file sharing
3. Build a text-based UI (TUI)
4. Host on a cloud server


<b>Server IP =127.0.0.1 (localhost)<br>
Client and server are on the same computer</b>

<b>For internet messages my friend use </b>
IP =163.227.144.23


# Acknowledgement
This project was built as a learning exercise to understand shell scripting and networking concepts step by step.

# Why This Project Is Special For Me
I want to socialize me to people who don't know me, those who didn't know my feelings and probably didn't interect ever. I really want to know this person. I am going to wait untill someone will read this and text me hi there.
